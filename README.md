## 📯 Philosophy

We recognize that developers today have the greatest power as a professional group to drive change and affect lives of billions. There are many platforms that provide developers with tools that serve to their success, or the goals of their workplace, but daily.dev is by-design for developers themselves. 

We, as developers, know how challenging it is to grow professionally with so much going on, and that's why we built daily.dev - to make it easy for us to navigate abundance of content and discover all the knowledge they need with zero effort.

You can use daily.dev to:

* 👨‍💻 Learn and stay up-to-date
* 🙌 Interact based on the latest trends in our ecosystem
* 🚀 Collaborate with other developers you know and appreciate
